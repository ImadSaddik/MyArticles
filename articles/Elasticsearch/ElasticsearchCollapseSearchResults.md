## Collapse search results

**Collapsing** is a cool feature that helps you show only the best document for each **group**. A group is a unique value in a field. Let's index some documents to show how collapse works in Elasticsearch.

### Indexing documents

Let's use the `Apod` dataset, which you can find in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/ImadSaddik/ElasticSearch_Python_Course/blob/main/data/apod.json). Start by reading the file.

```python
import json

with open("../data/apod.json") as f:
    documents = json.load(f)
```

Then, create an index.

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es = Elasticsearch("http://localhost:9200")

es.indices.delete(index="apod", ignore_unavailable=True)
es.indices.create(index="apod")
```

Use the `bulk API` to index the documents in the `apod index`.

```python
from tqdm import tqdm

operations = []
index_name = "apod"
for document in tqdm(documents, total=len(documents), desc="Indexing documents"):
    year = document["date"].split("-")[0]
    document["year"] = int(year)

    operations.append({"index": {"_index": index_name}})
    operations.append(document)

response = es.bulk(operations=operations)
response["errors"]
```

If the indexing is successful, you should see `response["errors"]` as `False`.

### Collapsing

Now, let's search for documents where `Andromeda galaxy` appears in the title.

```python
response_no_collapsing = es.search(
    index="apod",
    body={
        "query": {"match": {"title": "Andromeda galaxy"}},
        "size": 10_000,
    },
)
total_hits = response_no_collapsing["hits"]["total"]["value"]
print(f"Total hits before collapsing: {total_hits}")
total_returned_hits = len(response_no_collapsing["hits"]["hits"])
print(f"Total returned hits before collapsing: {total_returned_hits}")
```

Without collapsing, the search results will return all documents that match the query. In this case, the number is 270 documents.

```text
Total hits before collapsing: 270
Total returned hits before collapsing: 270
```

Let's look at the count of documents that matched the query per year in the `apod index`.

```python
from elastic_transport import ObjectApiResponse

def get_hits_per_year(response: ObjectApiResponse) -> dict:
    hits_per_year_count = {}
    for hit in response["hits"]["hits"]:
        year = hit["_source"]["year"]
        if year not in hits_per_year_count:
            hits_per_year_count[year] = 0
        hits_per_year_count[year] += 1
    return hits_per_year_count

print("Hits per year count:")
print(get_hits_per_year(response_no_collapsing))
```

We see that we have a lot of documents per year. What would happen if we collapse the search results by year?

```text
Hits per year count:
{
    2015: 28,
    2016: 29,
    2017: 31,
    2018: 19,
    2019: 32,
    2020: 25,
    2021: 24,
    2022: 30,
    2023: 32,
    2024: 20,
}
```

Collapsing search results by year will return only one document per year that matches the query. That returned document will be the one with the highest `_score` for that year.

```python
response_collapsing = es.search(
    index="apod",
    body={
        "query": {"match": {"title": "Andromeda galaxy"}},
        "collapse": {"field": "year"},
        "size": 10_000,
    },
)
total_hits = response_collapsing["hits"]["total"]["value"]
print(f"Total hits before collapsing: {total_hits}")
total_returned_hits = len(response_collapsing["hits"]["hits"])
print(f"Total returned hits after collapsing: {total_returned_hits}")
```

Now, we got 10 documents after collapsing the search results.

```text
Total hits before collapsing: 270
Total returned hits after collapsing: 10
```

Let's print the number of documents per year.

```python
print("Hits per year count:")
print(get_hits_per_year(response_collapsing))
```

Now we have only one document per year that matches the query.

```text
Hits per year count:
{
    2015: 1,
    2016: 1,
    2017: 1,
    2018: 1,
    2019: 1,
    2020: 1,
    2021: 1,
    2022: 1,
    2023: 1,
    2024: 1,
}
```

Let's check if the document in year 2024 is the one with the highest `_score`.

```python
for hit in response_collapsing["hits"]["hits"]:
    year = hit["_source"]["year"]
    if year == 2024:
        score = hit["_score"]
        print(f"Document with a score of {score} for year {year}:")
        print(hit["_source"])
        break
```

From the response with collapsing, we can see that the document in year 2024 has a `_score` of `7.789091`.

```text
Document with a score of 7.789091 for year 2024:

{
    "authors": "Subaru, Hubble, Mayall, R. Gendler, R. Croman",
    "date": "2024-09-08",
    "explanation": "Explanation: The most distant object easily visible to the unaided eye is M31, the great Andromeda Galaxy...",
    "image_url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/M31_HstSubaruGendler_960.jpg",
    "title": "M31: The Andromeda Galaxy",
    "year": 2024,
}
```

Let's look at the scores in the response without collapsing.

```python
for hit in response_no_collapsing["hits"]["hits"]:
    year = hit["_source"]["year"]
    if year == 2024:
        score = hit["_score"]
        print(f"Score {score}:")
        print(hit["_source"])
        print("-" * 50)
```

We confirm that the first hit from 2024 has a `_score` of `7.789091`, which is the same as the one in the response with collapsing.

```text
Score 7.789091:
{
    "authors": "Subaru, Hubble, Mayall, R. Gendler, R. Croman",
    "date": "2024-09-08",
    "explanation": "Explanation: The most distant object easily visible to the unaided eye is M31, the great Andromeda Galaxy...",
    "image_url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2409/M31_HstSubaruGendler_960.jpg",
    "title": "M31: The Andromeda Galaxy",
    "year": 2024,
}
--------------------------------------------------
Score 3.0710938:
{
    "authors": "Aman Chokshi",
    "date": "2024-07-14",
    "explanation": "Explanation: The galaxy was never in danger...",
    "image_url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2407/M33Meteor_Chokshi_960.jpg",
    "title": "Meteor Misses Galaxy",
    "year": 2024,
}
--------------------------------------------------
...
```

### Expanding collapsed results

Expanding collapsed results allows you to get more than one document per year that matches the query. To expand the results, we add `inner_hits` to `collapse`. The name `most_recent` will be used to extract those documents from the response object.

```python
response_collapsing = es.search(
    index="apod",
    body={
        "query": {"match": {"title": "Andromeda galaxy"}},
        "collapse": {
            "field": "year",
            "inner_hits": {
                "name": "most_recent",
                "size": 3,  # Number of documents to return per collapsed group
            },
        },
        "size": 10_000,
    },
)
total_hits = response_collapsing["hits"]["total"]["value"]
print(f"Total hits before collapsing: {total_hits}")
total_returned_hits = len(response_collapsing["hits"]["hits"])
print(f"Total returned hits after collapsing: {total_returned_hits}")
inner_hits = response_collapsing["hits"]["hits"][0]["inner_hits"]["most_recent"]
total_returned_hits_after_expanding = len(inner_hits["hits"]["hits"])
print(f"Total returned hits after expanding: {total_returned_hits_after_expanding}")
```

For each year, we get 3 documents inside the `inner_hits` field.

```text
Total hits before collapsing: 270
Total returned hits after collapsing: 10
Total returned hits after expanding: 3
```

Let's see how many documents we have in a single year.

```python
print("Hits per year count:")
print(get_hits_per_year(inner_hits))
```

We get 3 documents.

```text
Hits per year count:
{2024: 3}
```

The documents are sorted by `_score` within each collapsed group. They also match the scores in the response without collapsing.

```python
for hit in inner_hits["hits"]["hits"]:
    score = hit["_score"]
    print(f"Score: {score}")
```

```text
Score: 7.789091
Score: 3.0710938
Score: 2.792822
```

### Collapsing with search_after

When collapsing on a field with a lot of unique values, you can use the `search_after` parameter to paginate through the results.

> **Note:** You can't use the `scroll API` with collapsing. Use `search_after` instead.

Let's create a new index where we are going to create 40,000 documents. Each user will have 2 documents.

```python
documents = []
number_of_unique_user_ids = 20_000
for user_id in range(number_of_unique_user_ids):
    for i in range(2):
        documents.append(
            {
                "user_id": user_id,
                "title": f"Document {i} for user {user_id}",
                "content": f"This is the content of document {i} for user {user_id}.",
            }
        )

es.indices.delete(index="my_index", ignore_unavailable=True)
es.indices.create(index="my_index")

operations = []
for document in tqdm(documents, total=len(documents), desc="Indexing documents"):
    operations.append({"index": {"_index": "my_index"}})
    operations.append(document)

response = es.bulk(operations=operations)
response["errors"]
```

```text
Indexing documents: 100%|██████████| 40000/40000 [00:00<00:00, 1809508.07it/s]

False
```

Let's confirm that we have 40,000 documents in the index.

```python
document_count = es.count(index="my_index")
print(f"Total documents indexed: {document_count['count']}")
```

```text
Total documents indexed: 40000
```

Now we're ready to use `search_after` to paginate through the collapsed results. Since we have 2 documents per user, we can expect to have 20,000 collapsed results.

```python
collapsed_hits = []
search_after = None

while True:
    body = {
        "query": {"match": {"content": "document"}},
        "collapse": {"field": "user_id"},
        "sort": ["user_id"],
        "size": 10_000,
    }

    if search_after is not None:
        body["search_after"] = [search_after]

    response_collapsing = es.search(index="my_index", body=body)
    hits = response_collapsing["hits"]["hits"]

    if not hits:
        break

    search_after = hits[-1]["_source"]["user_id"]
    print(f"Last user ID: {search_after}")

    collapsed_hits.extend(hits)

print(f"Total collapsed hits: {len(collapsed_hits)}")
```

We see that the last user ID in the collapsed results is `19999` and the number of collapsed hits is `20000`, which is what we expected.

```text
Last user ID: 9999
Last user ID: 19999
Total collapsed hits: 20000
```

## Conclusion

 In this article, we explored how `collapsing` search results works in `Elasticsearch`. This feature helps you refine your search output by showing only the most relevant document from each `group`, like getting just one top result per year.

We learned how `collapsing` reduces the number of returned hits for a cleaner view, and how `inner_hits` can expand those results to show more details within each group.

For large datasets, we also saw that `search_after` is the way to paginate through collapsed results, especially when the `scroll API` isn't suitable. Understanding `collapsing` can really help you make your `Elasticsearch` searches more efficient and your data easier to work with.
